Wiki for the Divine Dungeon Universe


The following files are ignored from being synced, and as such can be customized by the individual. The files are settings for Hotkeys, Theme and Layout respectively.
Ignored Files: hotkeys.json, appearance.json, workspace.json

# Styling

I am using CSS for styling and formatting. The CSS can be found in .obsidian > snippets.
The home page has it's own snippet called "home"
The Series pages have one called "dashboard"
The Book pages have one called "book"

# Adding Books
When adding Books, add them to the list on the [Books](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki&file=Books%2FBooks) page. Once the book page is created, fill in the tags and it will auto populate into the Series List.
