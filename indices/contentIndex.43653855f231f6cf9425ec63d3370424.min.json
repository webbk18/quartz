He’s ready to fail at the most difficult challenge in the world: cultivation.  \n  \nToo corrupted to even take the first steps, the sly old elder simply agreed with those who told him that it was impossible. Then he quietly ignored them, rubbed his hands together, and started anyway. He had always failed in what he did: he lost his way from the academy, his command was devastated by a Mage, he lost his town, and now his last hopes for the future had been stolen by a group of raiders. The only thing that had never failed him was his sharp mind and philosophy. He _would_ cultivate... no matter what it cost him.  \n  \nA lifetime of failure can dull and dampen a soul. A reason to live, a goal, can change that in an instant. It is always darkest just before the dawn.\n\n\n\n# Books\n\n```dataview\nTABLE book-number AS \"Book Number\", publish-year AS \"Year Published\", narrator AS \"Narrator\"\nWHERE category = \"book\" AND series = \"AA\"\nsort book-number\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-20T15:47:41.288973163Z","tags":null},"/Books/Books":{"title":"","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003eBOOKS\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n| [[Home]] | [Atlas](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki\u0026file=Atlas%2FAtlas) |[Characters](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki\u0026file=Characters%2FCharacters) | [Bestiary](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki\u0026file=Bestiary%2FBestiary) | [Books](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki\u0026file=Books%2FBooks)| [Lexicon](obsidian://open?file=CAL-Wiki\u0026file=Lexicon%2FLexicon) | \n| -------- | -------|------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |\n\n\n-----\n\n# [[Artorian's Archives]]\n1.

A sheep-herder turned Noble. Their path to ascendance through cultivation.**\n\nConquering dungeons and using them to grow has long been the most efficient way to become a powerful adventurer. The only thing keeping the process from being easy is the Beasts that inhabit these places. Questions plague those entering this particular place of power: Where do the ‘rewards’ of weapons, armor, and heavy gold coins come from? Why is a fluffy bunny charging at me? For abyss-sake, why are there so many monsters?\n\nCal has all of the answers to these age-old questions for a very simple reason. He is a Dungeon Core, a soul forced against his will into a magical stone. With the help of an energetic friend, Cal grows a dungeon around himself to bring in new sources of power.\n\nWhen a threat he doesn’t fully comprehend bares its many teeth, Cal is determined to survive the attempt on his life. Unfortunately for adventurers, the only way for him to achieve his goal is to eat anyone that enters his depths.\n\n\n\n# Books\n\n```dataview\nTABLE book-number AS \"Book Number\", publish-year AS \"Year Published\", narrator AS \"Narrator\"\nWHERE category = \"book\" AND series = \"DD\"\nsort book-number\n```\n\n1.
